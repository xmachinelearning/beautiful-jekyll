This package implements an approach for missing view and missing data imputation via generative adversarial networks (GANs), which we name as VIGAN. It combines cross-domain relations given unpaired data with multi-view relations given paired data. This approach first treats each view as a separate domain and identifies domain-to-domain mappings through GANs using randomly-sampled data from each view, and then employs a multi-modal denoising autoencoder (DAE) to reconstruct the missing view from the GAN outputs based on paired data from each view. Then, by optimizing the GANs and DAE jointly, our model enables the knowledge integration learned for domain mappings and view correspondences to effectively recover the missing view.  

Intuitively, the cycle-consistent GAN model learns to translate data between two views, and the translated data can be viewed as an initial estimate of the missing values or a noisy version of the true data. The autoencoder is used to refine the estimate by denoising the GAN outputs. Our approach makes use of all resources with missing data to reconstruct the missing view.

*What is missing view problem?
	* There are distinct mechanisms to collect data from multiple aspects or sources. In multi-view data analysis, samples are characterized or viewed in multiple ways, thus creating multiple sets of input variables for the same sample. For instance, a genetic study of a complex disease may produce two data matrices respectively for genotypes and clinical symptoms, and the records in the two matrices are paired for each patient. In a dataset with three or more views, there exists a one-to-one mapping across the records of every view. In practice, it is however more common that data collected from different sources are for different sam- ples, which leads to multi-modal data analysis. To study Alzheimerâ€™s disease, a US initiative collected neuroimages (a modality) for a sample of patients and brain signals such as electroencephalograms (another modality) for a different sample of patients, resulting in unpaired data. The integra- tion of these datasets in a unified analysis requires different mathematical modeling from the multi-view data analysis because there is no longer a one-to-one mapping across the different modalities. This problem is also frequently referred to domain mapping or domain adaptation in various scenarios. The method that we propose herein can handle both the multi-view and multi-modal missing data problem.
