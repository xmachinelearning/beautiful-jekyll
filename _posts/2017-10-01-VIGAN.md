This package implements an approach for missing view and missing data imputation via generative adversarial networks (GANs), which we name as VIGAN. It combines cross-domain relations given unpaired data with multi-view relations given paired data. This approach first treats each view as a separate domain and identifies domain-to-domain mappings through GANs using randomly-sampled data from each view, and then employs a multi-modal denoising autoencoder (DAE) to reconstruct the missing view from the GAN outputs based on paired data from each view. Then, by optimizing the GANs and DAE jointly, our model enables the knowledge integration learned for domain mappings and view correspondences to effectively recover the missing view.  

Intuitively, the cycle-consistent GAN model learns to translate data between two views, and the translated data can be viewed as an initial estimate of the missing values or a noisy version of the true data. The autoencoder is used to refine the estimate by denoising the GAN outputs. Our approach makes use of all resources with missing data to reconstruct the missing view.
